### Overview

An easy way to access Codeigniter libraries from composer. Somtimes you want to use some of amazing libraries from [Codeigniter](http://codeigniter.com/) but you are not using the Codeigniter framework. 

With this package we are taking libraries by hand from Codeigniter 2.1.3 and making them available via composer.

Please note Codeigniter is an open source framework owned by [EllisLab](http://ellislab.com/). This is just a "fork" of sorts.
